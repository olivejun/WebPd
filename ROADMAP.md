### Planned features v1.0.0

#### Receiving messages from the patch (outlet listeners)

STATUS : There is already all the infrastructure for this in place. The only thing missing is a way for users to specify to the compiler which nodes should be listened to for messages. In particular, for now `outlet listeners` (as well as `inlet callers`, their counterparts for sending message to the patch) are specified by passing the compiler a node ID. Issue with that is that it is not easy for the user to guess the ID of a given node after compilation.
